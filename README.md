# 19N0R3 POetry Server Side

> This repository is created as part of my study about nodejs. I use the fetch method in vanilla js, so that I can connect it thru the server side. I use the API method to share the data from the server to the client side.

This is all developed and shared for free. Open to clone, but I won't allow someone to sell my projects, not just this repository, but also the other repository, created under my name and MPOP Reverse II.
